### Overview
In this lesson, we want to give you an introduction to the simulation method of Agent-based Modeling (often abbreviated ABM) via the example of an Agent-based model based on a historical letter sending network, implemented with the python-package 'mesa'.

In the **first part**, you will learn what historical simulation methods are all about, what some of their methodological and epistmeological quirks are, and how to start applying Agent-based Modeling for your own research needs.

In the **second part**, you can follow a step-by-step guide to build your first Agent-based Model with 'Mesa'. This will be accompanied by further comments and reflections on the methoodlogy of Agent-based Modeling.

In the **third part**, we will tell you about ways to extend the model and further enhance your abilities in building ABMs by giving you some issues to think about as well as links to other ressources.

The case study in part 2 will use openly available letter data from the period of the 'Republic of Letters', sourced from the [LetterSampo](https://lettersampo.demo.seco.cs.aalto.fi/en)-project, for comparision (more on that below). The model which we will build together will incorporate some basic interactions like letter sending that lead to correspondence networks similar to those observed in the data-set.

The goal of this (very basic) model is to better understand the social dynamics of correspondence networks and how those shape which letters survive until today and which are destroyed or forgotten over time. It won't be sufficiently complex to give genuinely valuable perspectives on this research goal, but it will highlight some key properties of Agent-based Modeling and ways to implement them. More on this in part 3.

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to extend the model further with more complex functionalities. We will also mention alternative approaches to the data as well as Agent-based Modeling applications for research areas and data types other than letter networks. In any case, the technical basics we teach about 'mesa' will be of use to you, even if you don't work with letters or networks in general!

### Lesson Goals Summarized
This lesson intends to:
- teach conceptual basics of simulation methods and 'Agent-based Modeling' for historians,
- teach fundamentals of the python-package 'mesa' for programming Agent-based Modeling,
- give you guidance and resources for extending your Agent-based Modeling knowledge beyond this tutorial, as well as
- give an overview over methodological and epistemological caveats, challenges, and things to think about when programming your own historical Agent-based Models.

Users of different skill levels and interests will find this lesson useful, for example if:
- you are completely unfamiliar with simulation methods and Agent-based Modeling and want a thorough introduction,
- you already know about Agent-based Modeling conceptually and are wondering whether it can be useful for your own research project,
- you already know that Agent-based Modeling might be useful for your research and now want to learn about how the process of modeling and technical implementation of an Agent-based Modeling can work,
- you are familiar with all of the above and need a starting point for implementing Agent-based Models with 'mesa'.

### Technical Requirements

For this lesson, mesa and its dependencies are necessary. Additionally we will use matplotlib for visualizations and numpy for some calculations.

Execute the following code block to install mesa and its dependencies. If you want to follow through the tutorial on your local machine, you need to set up an environment with mesa installed. If you don't know how to do this, we have a simple [step-by-step instruction](https://gitlab.gwdg.de/modelsen/Agent-based Modeling-workshop-setup-instructions), which we compiled for a workshop.

Setup an environment:
If you already have Python installed, running the following code in a terminal should give you a new virtual environment with the mesa package:

```
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
pip install mesa
```
If you would like to have a more gentle and comprehensive introduction, head over to the tutorial introducing [Python](https://programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/introduction-and-installation).


```python
try:
  import mesa
except:
  !pip install mesa
```


## Part 1: Introduction to Simulations and Agent-based Modeling
Before we dive into the technical side of Agent-based Modeling, we want to give you some background on what Simulation and Agent-based Modeling is about, what it has to offer for historical research, and how it might relate to your research!

First off, we want to start with a more thorough introduction into the historical case we want to present to you in this lesson as well as other possible research subjects that might lead you to using Agent-based Modeling.

### 1.1 Motivations for Historical Simulation / Why using Historical Simulations

In this lesson, we are motivated to try and better understand the social dynamics that might have shaped intellectual networks in the past, specifically during the early modern period. In this time in Europe, a primarily letter-based network of scholars of different nationalities emerged, often referred to as the 'Republic of Letters'. The effect of this network on the history of science in Europe and the world is deemed to be pivotal,[CITATION]() but beyond studying the shape of the networks and speculating about the historical sources we have, it is hard to understand why and how these networks came to the shape we observe today.

Questions related to this interest, such as the following, are usually hard to answer in a systematic and methodologically sound way: Which social and intellectual dynamics led to some people being central in the network? How did people form and develop their connections in the network? What effect did simple limiting elements such as distance, infrastructure and technology have on the shape of the network?

We can pose some limited hypotheses regarding those questions and might draw on network research or the sources for some hints and correlations, but it is hard to reliably test those hypotheses. One of the main motivations of using historical simulation methods is exactly that: testing and experimenting with hypotheses about the past.

Building a simulation model of this letter network would allow us to represent different hypotheses about its dynamics and might help us gain a more thorough understanding of its workings. But what does it actually mean to build a simulation?

Or to ask more broadly...

### 1.2. What are Simulations?

To start of with, we want to give you a very general definition of the term 'simulation', before we dive into what this actually means:

```
The term 'simulation' describes a number of different methods of model-based, experimental reproduction of a real-world or hypothetical process or system.
[CITATION: in german, unfortunately](https://zfdg.de/wp_2023_011)
```

As the definition says, the basis of every simulation is an executable simulation model. This is a class of models - similar to data models - that can be expressed conceptually, logically or mathematically. To execute a simulation model, however, it must be formalized, i.e., converted into a computer-readable form. Just like we would do in a data model, we formally describe our ideas of a person, place or the event of a letter exchange, but additionally we describe triggers for certain actions, for movements, as well as interaction rules into a simulation model.

We can then run this model, the actual simulation, to see how these rules, attributes, decisions, etc. in our letter exchange model play out together over time. Once we observed these new informations of our simulation run, our model can be revised and then run again. The process of building a simulation model is constantly cycling between phases of running the model, interpreting the results and then adapting the model for further experiments. This way, simulation methodology very much comparable to the  hermeneutic circle of heuristics, critique, and interpretation historians are used to.

Now to the last part of the definition regarding real-world or hypothetical subject matters. Many historians rightly hold a cautious view on the nature of historical reality and - more importantly - our ability as scholars to describe it.[CITATION]() Just as sources are king in traditional history, data is queen in Digital History. However, as we already tried to highlight, the subject of simulations is by its experimental nature the hypotheticals of history, thus all the assumptions we have about the past that tie together our data to a plausible narrative. By building a historical simulation model we are automatically asking "How *could* it have been?". The alluring but at the same time tricky opportunity of historical simulations therefore is to go beyond and between the actual data we have at our disposal in a formalized way. The crucial difference here to epistemologically similar, traditional counterfactual approaches to history is the formalized, systematic and experimental nature of simulations.

We mainly talked about historical simulations as analytical tools to research history and this will remain our focus in this lesson. However, we want to stress that simulation methods, in a slightly different way of defining them, are used in other ways in the historical sciences. Apart from their analytical purpose, simulations are used as didactic tools for interactive and immersive teaching, they are sometimes a synonym for more static 3D reconstructions which are used to visualise past spaces, and they are themselves the subject of research, for example in the history of science, philsophy of history or in media history. [CITATION](Further reading on differences of simulations)

Now that you have a general idea of what historical simulations are about theoretically, we need to dive into what a good methodological approach for our case is. We want to model the interactions of individuals - the people sending letters to each other. Thus, we need a modeling approach that emphasizes those one-on-one interactions: a so called Agent-based Model.


### 1.3: What is Agent-based Modeling?

Agent-based modeling (sometimes ABM for short) is a simulation method where relations and interactions of individual entities, for example humans, organizations, items, etc., with each other and with their environment are simulated.[CITATION: ABM Compendium](https://modelsen.mpiwg-berlin.mpg.de/tutorials/abm_intro/ch2_abm/abm_main.html)

Ideally, these interactions make some emergent patterns appear, meaning they are not prescribed in the simulation by the researcher, but dynamically arise out of the system. In our case, for example, we actively don't want to prescribe in the model how the letter network should look in the end. We would like to see the shape of the letter network emerge dynamically from the letter-sending-rules we will describe. If the shape differs wildly from what we observe in our data, we know we are probably way off with our hypotheses (or the way we formalized them).

Agent-based Models are especially suited to allow those emergent processes. In general, emergent phenomena in human activity and behavior pose a number of questions that are of central interest for and feature much in debates among historians, such as: How and why did a society change? Why did some states get the upper hand over others in some time frame? How did some new technology or idea spread from one group of people to another? These questions, it has to be stressed, do not encompass those we have about actual, specific individuals. For our case, for example, we wouldn't be able to ask "Why did Christiaan Huygens send this particular letter to Johannes Hevelius?", but rather "Is there a reason and pattern in intellectuals of that era sending each other letters?".

As a simulation method, Agent-based Modeling offers the opportunity to formally and systematically pursue these kinds of questions by building models of the pertaining case study and experiment with that model.

While mathematics can still play a major role in it, Agent-based Modeling is not as dependent on equations as other approaches and hence is more flexible. Purely mathematical approaches, while very effective for certain applications, are limiting in a number of ways that are especially relevant for history. For example, it is not easy - or often even impossible - to describe heterogenous behavior of people in purely mathematical terms. Mathematics is often too formal of a language to deal with many intricacies of human behavior that historians will want to represent in their models Agent-based Models are instead usually written in common object-oriented programming languages, such as Python, or with purpose built languages such as NetLogo.

To summarize, the goal of this method is to link the emergent patterns and phenomena at the systemic macro-level with the individual micro-level behavior of interacting entities, the name-giving "Agents". The focus are often the patterns and underlying dynamics in history than any unique case on its own.


### 1.4: Historical Context of Agent-based Modeling

Simulations were among of the first digital methods applied in historical research. Some of the earlier historical simulations were done by prominent figures of the early digital humanities and digital history, such as Michael Levison[CITATION]() or Peter Laslett of the Cambridge Group for the History of Population and Social Structure.[CITATION]() The latter also coined this simulative approach to history "experimental history", to underline the experimental and iterative nature of the process.[CITATION]()

Agent-based Modeling as a term for the kind of simulation approach we just described was coined during the 1990s, pioneered among others by Robert Axtell.[CITATION]()

Similar, individual-based simulation approaches have existed for at least the 1960s, though. Tim Gooding puts the origins of Agent-based Modeling at 1933, when Enrico Fermi first used the so-called Monte-Carlo-Method with mechanical computing machines [CITATION](Agent-Based Model History and Development, 2019). Some early examples include the aforementioned Peter Laslett, who, together with Anthropologist Eugene Hammel and Computer scientist Kenneth W. Wachter, devised individual-based Monte-Carlo Simulations on household structures in early modern England.[CITATION]()

Since then, a number of changes occured that warrent a distinction between those efforts and the newer, actual Agent-based Models. For one, changes in hardware, software and programming paradigms has lead to a much higher performance and affordability of bigger and more complex models. Also, the epistemological framework of emergent properties in systems we described in 1.2 is heavily inspired by modern thinking on Complex Adaptive Systems, which itself has roots into the 1950s and beyond, but is mainly a product of recent scholarly activity.[CITATION]() In the newer Agent-based Modeling, there is a bigger principle emphasis on the relevance of heterogenuous agents, processes of social learning, coupling of micro- and macro-level phenomena and on theory-agnosticism.

Today, Agent-based Modeling and simulations in general are starting to appear more frequently in historical research, most notably in Archaeology, but in the context of Digital History and Digital Humanities as well.[CITATION]()

## Part 2: Programming Agent-based Models with Mesa

In this chapter, we will start to actually implement a simple simulation model of early modern letter exchange using the python package Mesa. Before we start, we will reiterate our exact goals for this model, which will guide the process of building it. We then start off by clarifying some key concepts of Agent-based Models that might be unclear to a newcomer to the method.

### 2.3 Overview of Mesa

In this tutorial we will make use of `mesa`, an open-source Agent-based Modeling framework written in Python. Mesa offers predefined functions to implement the key ingredients of an Agent-based Modeling. The package is in development since 2015 and has aquired a large community of users and contributors [LINK]. Its relative longevity and popularity makes it a good choice to start using Agent-based Modeling.

If you are more familiar with other programming languages, you can consider applying the ideas of this tutorial, e.g., in the frameworks [NetLogo (a dedicated Agent-based Modeling language)](https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/) or [MASON (based on Java)](https://cs.gmu.edu/~eclab/projects/mason/).

In `mesa` a minimal Agent-based Modeling implementation consists of a definition of an "agent" class and a "model" class. The "model" class holds the model-level attributes (for example attributes of the environment or other external factors), manages the agents, and generally handles the global processing level of our model.

Each instantiation of the model class will be a specific model run. Each model will contain multiple agents, all of which are instantiations of the agent class. Both the model and agent classes are child classes of Mesa‚Äôs generic model and agent classes. In line with the above introduced idea of *individual-based* modeling, each agent should have a unique id to allow tracking during the simulation.

Another important aspect of mesa is the `scheduler`. The scheduler keeps track of which agent should act when. This process is called "activation" in the terms of mesa, and there are a number of predifined activation procedures: random, simultaneous, or staged activation. For this tutorial we will make use of random activation, meaning that all agents act one after another, but the order is random at each new step of the model.

Some research questions might require the agents to interact in/with a `space`. This could be a geographical space or something more abstract. Sometimes, like in this tutorial, a simple abstracted representation of relative distance is sufficient, for example in form of a two-dimensional *grid*. Mesa also supports hexagonal, continues or network grids, which are useful for e.g. covering a geographical space or simulating social relations. If a simulation relies on geographical map projections, an additional package from the mesa project might be useful: [mesa-geo](https://github.com/projectmesa/mesa-geo).



### 2.4 Building the Model




#### 2.4.1 Model **Outline**

The tutorial model is a very simple simulated agent-based letter network. The rules of our tutorial model:

1. There are some number of agents.

2. All agents begin with 0 letters.

3. At every step of the model, an agent sends a letter to some other agent, based either on randomness or distance to the other agents.

Let‚Äôs get started!


```python
"""To start with, let's import the mesa module"""
import mesa
```

#### 2.4.2 Setting up the model
To begin writing the model code, we start with two core classes: one for the overall `model`, the other for the `agents`. The model class holds the model-level attributes, manages the agents, and generally handles the global level of our model. Each instantiation of the model class will be a specific model run. Each model will contain multiple agents, all of which are instantiations of the agent class. Both the model and agent classes are child classes of Mesa‚Äôs generic [Model and Agent classes](https://mesa.readthedocs.io/en/stable/apis/init.html).

This is seen in the code with `class LetterModel(mesa.Model)` or `class LetterAgent(mesa.Agent)`.

For now, each agent has only two variables: how much letters it currently has sent and received. Each agent will also have a unique identifier (i.e., a name), stored in the `unique_id` variable. Giving each agent a unique id is a good practice when doing agent-based modeling.

There is only one model-level parameter: how many agents the model contains. When a new model is started, we want it to populate itself with the given number of agents.

The beginning of both classes looks like this:


```python
class LetterAgent(mesa.Agent):
    """An agent with a fixed amount of initial letters, namely 0."""

    def __init__(self, unique_id, model):
        super().__init__(unique_id, model)
        self.letters_sent = 0
        self.letters_received = 0


class LetterModel(mesa.Model):
    """A model with some number of agents."""

    def __init__(self, N):
        super().__init__()
        self.num_agents = N
        # Create N number of agents
        for i in range(self.num_agents):
            a = LetterAgent(i, self)
```

#### 2.4.3 Adding the scheduler

Time in most agent-based models moves in steps, sometimes also called ticks. At each step of the model, one or more of the agents ‚Äì usually all of them ‚Äì are activated and take their own step, changing internally and/or interacting with one another or the environment.

The scheduler is a special model component which controls the order in which agents are activated. For example, all the agents may activate in the same order every step, their order might be shuffled, we may try to simulate all the agents acting at the same time, and more. Mesa offers a few different built-in scheduler classes, with a common interface. That makes it easy to change the activation regime a given model uses, and see whether it changes the model behavior. This may not seem important, but scheduling patterns can have an impact on your results [Comer2014].

For now, let's use one of the simplest ones: `RandomActivation`*, which activates all the agents once per step, in random order. Every agent is expected to have a ``step`` method. The step method is the action the agent takes when it is activated by the model schedule. We add an agent to the schedule using the `add` method; when we call the schedule's `step` method, the model shuffles the order of the agents, then activates and executes each agent's ```step``` method.

*Unlike `mesa.model` or `mesa.agent`, `mesa.time` has multiple classes (e.g. `RandomActivation`, `StagedActivation` etc). To ensure context, time is used in the import as evidenced below with `mesa.time.RandomActivation`.  You can see the different time classes as [mesa.time](https://github.com/projectmesa/mesa/blob/main/mesa/time.py).

With that in mind, the model code with the scheduler added looks like this:


```python
class LetterAgent(mesa.Agent):
    """An agent with a fixed amount of initial letters, namely 0."""

    def __init__(self, unique_id, model):
        super().__init__(unique_id, model)
        self.letters_sent = 0
        self.letters_received = 0

    def step(self):
        # The agent's step will go here.
        # For demonstration purposes we will print the agent's unique_id
        print("Hi, I am agent " + str(self.unique_id) + ".")

class LetterModel(mesa.Model):
    """A model with some number of agents."""

    def __init__(self, N):
        super().__init__()
        self.num_agents = N
        self.schedule = mesa.time.RandomActivation(self)
        # Create N number of agents
        for i in range(self.num_agents):
            a = LetterAgent(i, self)
            self.schedule.add(a)

    def step(self):
        """Advance the model by one step."""
        self.schedule.step()
```

At this point, we have a model which runs ‚Äì it just doesn‚Äôt do anything. You can see for yourself with a few easy lines:


```python
empty_model = LetterModel(10) # create a model with 10 agents
empty_model.step() # execute the step function once
```

#### 2.4.4 Agent Step

Now we just need to have the agents do what we intend for them to do: send each other letters.

To allow the agent to choose another agent at random, we use the `model.random` random-number generator. This works just like Python‚Äôs `random` module, but with a fixed seed set when the model is instantiated, that can be used to replicate a specific model run later.

To pick an agent at random, we need a list of all agents. Notice that there isn‚Äôt such a list explicitly in the model. The scheduler, however, does have an internal list of all the agents it is scheduled to activate.

With that in mind, we rewrite the agent `step` method, like this:


```python
class LetterAgent(mesa.Agent):
    """An agent with a fixed amount of initial letters, namely 0."""

    def __init__(self, unique_id, model):
        super().__init__(unique_id, model)
        self.letters_sent = 0
        self.letters_received = 0

    def step(self):

        other_agent = self.random.choice(self.model.schedule.agents)
        other_agent.letters_received += 1
        self.letters_sent += 1
```

#### 2.4.5 Running your first model

With that last piece in hand, it‚Äôs time for the first rudimentary run of the model. Let‚Äôs create a model with 10 agents, and run it for 20 steps.


```python
model = LetterModel(10)
for i in range(20):
    model.step()
```

Next, we need to get some data out of the model.
Specifically, we want to see how many letters each agent sent and received. We can get the letters values with list comprehension, and then use `matplotlib` (or another graphics library) to visualize the data in a histogram.


```python
# import matplotlib for our visualization
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```


```python
agent_letters_recd = [b.letters_received for b in model.schedule.agents]
plt.hist(agent_letters_recd)
plt.show()
```

You‚Äôll should see something like the distribution above. Yours will almost certainly look at least slightly different, since each run of the model is random and unique, after all.

To get a better idea of how a model behaves, we can create multiple model runs and see the distribution that emerges from all of them. We can do this with a nested for loop:


```python
all_letters = []

# This runs the model 100 times, each model executing 10 steps.
for j in range(100):
    # Run the model
    model = LetterModel(10)
    for i in range(10):
        model.step()

    # Store the results
    for agent in model.schedule.agents:
        all_letters.append(agent.letters_received)

plt.hist(all_letters, bins=range(max(all_letters) + 1))
plt.show()
```

This runs 100 instantiations of the model, and runs each for 10 steps. (Notice that we set the histogram bins to be integers, since agents can only have whole numbers of letters). This distribution looks a lot smoother. By running the model 100 times, we smooth out some of the ‚Äònoise‚Äô of randomness, and get to the model‚Äôs overall expected behavior.

For now, the letter distribution looks pretty normal in a mathematical sense, because it is basically random. These results are not too surprising, yet. Let's add some more comparably realistic behavior by introducing space between the agents and let that influence the letter sending decision.

#### 2.4.6 Adding space

Many ABMs have a spatial element, with agents moving around and interacting with nearby neighbors. Mesa currently supports two overall kinds of spaces:
`grid`, and `continuous`. Grids are divided into cells, and agents can only be on a particular cell, like pieces on a chess board. Continuous space, in contrast, allows agents to have any arbitrary position. Both grids and continuous spaces are frequently toroidal, meaning that the edges of this 'world' wrap around, with cells on the right edge connected to those on the left edge, and the top to the bottom. This prevents some cells having fewer neighbors than others, or agents being able to go off the edge of the environment.

Let‚Äôs add a simple spatial element to our model by putting our agents on a grid and make them walk around at random. Instead of sending a letter to any random agent, they‚Äôll give it to an agent on the same cell. We could imagine that this represents them being close enough to know of one another and have reason to send a letter in the first place.

Mesa has two main types of grids: `SingleGrid` and `MultiGrid`.<a name="cite_ref-1"></a>[<sup>*</sup>](#cite_note-1) `SingleGrid` enforces at most one agent per cell; `MultiGrid` allows multiple agents to be in the same cell. Since we want agents to be able to share a cell, we use `MultiGrid`.

We instantiate a grid with width and height parameters, and a boolean as to whether the grid is toroidal. Let‚Äôs make width and height model parameters, in addition to the number of agents, and have the grid always be toroidal. We can place agents on a grid with the grid‚Äôs `place_agent` method, which takes an agent and an (x, y) tuple of the coordinates to place the agent.

<a name="cite_note-1"></a>1. [^](#cite_ref-1) However there are more types of space to include `HexGrid`, `NetworkGrid`, and the previously mentioned `ContinuousSpace`. Similar to `mesa.time` context is retained with `mesa.space.[enter class]`. You can see the different classes as `mesa.space`.


```python
class LetterModel(mesa.Model):
    """A model with some number of agents."""

    def __init__(self, N, width, height):
        super().__init__()
        self.num_agents = N
        self.grid = mesa.space.MultiGrid(width, height, True)
        self.schedule = mesa.time.RandomActivation(self)

        # Create agents
        for i in range(self.num_agents):
            a = LetterAgent(i, self)
            self.schedule.add(a)

            # Add the agent to a random grid cell
            x = self.random.randrange(self.grid.width)
            y = self.random.randrange(self.grid.height)
            self.grid.place_agent(a, (x, y))
```

Under the hood, each agent‚Äôs position is stored in two ways: the agent is contained in the grid in the cell it is currently in, and the agent has a `pos` variable with an (x, y) coordinate tuple. The `place_agent` method adds the coordinate to the agent automatically.

Now we need to add to the agents‚Äô behaviors, letting them move around and only send letters to other agents in the same cell.

First, let‚Äôs handle movement, and have the agents move to a neighboring cell. The grid object provides a `move_agent` method, which, like you would imagine, moves an agent to a given cell. That still leaves us to get the possible neighboring cells to move to. There are a couple ways to do this. One is to use the current coordinates, and loop over all coordinates +/- 1 away from it. For example:

```python
neighbors = []
x, y = self.pos
for dx in [-1, 0, 1]:
    for dy in [-1, 0, 1]:
        neighbors.append((x+dx, y+dy))
```

But there‚Äôs an even simpler way, using the grid‚Äôs built-in `get_neighborhood` method, which returns all the neighbors of a given cell. This method can get two types of cell neighborhoods: [Moore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore_neighborhood) (includes all 8 surrounding squares), and [Von Neumann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Neumann_neighborhood) (only includes the 4 top, bottom, left and right neighboring squares). It also needs an argument as to whether to include the center cell itself as one of the neighbors.

With that in mind, the agent‚Äôs move method looks like this:

```python
class LetterAgent(mesa.Agent):
   #...
    def move(self):
        possible_steps = self.model.grid.get_neighborhood(
            self.pos,
            moore=True,
            include_center=False)
        new_position = self.random.choice(possible_steps)
        self.model.grid.move_agent(self, new_position)
```

Next, we need to get all the other agents present in a cell, and sent one of them a letter. We can get the contents of one or more cells using the grid's `get_cell_list_contents` method, or by accessing a cell directly. The method accepts a list of cell coordinate tuples, or a single tuple if we only care about one cell.

```python
class LetterAgent(mesa.Agent):
    #...
    def send_letter(self):
        cellmates = self.model.grid.get_cell_list_contents([self.pos])
        if len(cellmates) > 1:
            other = self.random.choice(cellmates)
            other.letters_received += 1
            self.letters_sent -= 1
```

And with those two methods, the agent's ``step`` method becomes:

```python
class LetterAgent(mesa.Agent):
    # ...
    def step(self):
        self.move()
        self.send_letter()
```

Now, putting that all together should look like this:


```python
class LetterAgent(mesa.Agent):
    """An agent with letters sent and received.

    The agent can move to agents in other grid cells
    and send letters to agents in the same grid cell.
    """

    def __init__(self, unique_id, model):
        super().__init__(unique_id, model)
        self.letters_sent = 0
        self.letters_received = 0

    def move(self):
        possible_steps = self.model.grid.get_neighborhood(
            self.pos, moore=True, include_center=False
        )
        new_position = self.random.choice(possible_steps)
        self.model.grid.move_agent(self, new_position)

    def send_letter(self):
        cellmates = self.model.grid.get_cell_list_contents([self.pos])
        if len(cellmates) > 1:
            other_agent = self.random.choice(cellmates)
            other_agent.letters_received += 1
            self.letters_sent += 1

    def step(self):
        self.move()
        self.send_letter()


class LetterModel(mesa.Model):
    """A model with some number of agents."""

    def __init__(self, N, width, height):
        super().__init__()
        self.num_agents = N
        self.grid = mesa.space.MultiGrid(width, height, True)
        self.schedule = mesa.time.RandomActivation(self)
        # Create agents
        for i in range(self.num_agents):
            a = LetterAgent(i, self)
            self.schedule.add(a)
            # Add the agent to a random grid cell
            x = self.random.randrange(self.grid.width)
            y = self.random.randrange(self.grid.height)
            self.grid.place_agent(a, (x, y))

    def step(self):
        self.schedule.step()
```

Let's create a model with 50 agents on a 10x10 grid, and run it for 20 steps.


```python
model = LetterModel(50, 10, 10)
for i in range(20):
    model.step()
```

Now let's use `matplotlib` and `numpy` to visualize the number of agents residing in each cell. To do that, we create a numpy array of the same size as the grid, filled with zeros. Then we use the grid object's `coord_iter()` feature, which lets us loop over every cell in the grid, giving us each cell's coordinates and contents in turn.


```python
import numpy as np

agent_counts = np.zeros((model.grid.width, model.grid.height))
for cell in model.grid.coord_iter():
    cell_content, coord = cell
    x, y = coord
    agent_count = len(cell_content)
    agent_counts[x][y] = agent_count
plt.imshow(agent_counts, interpolation="nearest")
plt.colorbar()

```

#### 2.4.7 Collecting Data

So far, at the end of every model run, we've had to go and write our own code to get the data out of the model. This has two problems: it isn't very efficient, and it only gives us end results. If we wanted to know the letter counts of each agent at each step, we'd have to add that to the loop of executing steps, and figure out some way to store the data.

Since one of the main goals of agent-based modeling is generating data for analysis, Mesa provides a class which can handle data collection and storage for us and make it easier to analyze.

The data collector stores three categories of data: model-level variables, agent-level variables, and tables (which are a catch-all for everything else). Model- and agent-level variables are added to the data collector along with a function for collecting them. Model-level collection functions take a model object as an input, while agent-level collection functions take an agent object as an input. Both then return a value computed from the model or each agent at their current state. When the data collector‚Äôs `collect` method is called, with a model object as its argument, it applies each model-level collection function to the model, and stores the results in a dictionary, associating the current value with the current step of the model. Similarly, the method applies each agent-level collection function to each agent currently in the schedule, associating the resulting value with the step of the model, and the agent‚Äôs `unique_id`.

Let's add a `DataCollector` to the model with [`mesa.DataCollector`](https://github.com/projectmesa/mesa/blob/main/mesa/datacollection.py), and collect two variables at the agent level. We want to collect every agent's letters sent and letters received at every step. Additionally, we define a new function to collect data on the model level. This function just collects all received letters from all agents in to one number.


```python
def compute_received_letters(model):
    number_of_received_letters = 0
    for agent in model.schedule.agents:
        number_of_received_letters += agent.letters_received
    return number_of_received_letters
```


```python
class LetterAgent(mesa.Agent):
    """An agent with letters sent and letters received."""

    def __init__(self, unique_id, model):
        super().__init__(unique_id, model)
        self.letters_sent = 0
        self.letters_received = 0

    def move(self):
        possible_steps = self.model.grid.get_neighborhood(
            self.pos, moore=True, include_center=False
        )
        new_position = self.random.choice(possible_steps)
        self.model.grid.move_agent(self, new_position)

    def send_letter(self):
        cellmates = self.model.grid.get_cell_list_contents([self.pos])
        if len(cellmates) > 1:
            other_agent = self.random.choice(cellmates)
            other_agent.letters_received += 1
            self.letters_sent += 1

    def step(self):
        self.move()
        self.send_letter()


class LetterModel(mesa.Model):
    """A model with some number of agents."""

    def __init__(self, N, width, height):
        super().__init__()
        self.num_agents = N
        self.grid = mesa.space.MultiGrid(width, height, True)
        self.schedule = mesa.time.RandomActivation(self)
        # Create agents
        for i in range(self.num_agents):
            a = LetterAgent(i, self)
            self.schedule.add(a)
            # Add the agent to a random grid cell
            x = self.random.randrange(self.grid.width)
            y = self.random.randrange(self.grid.height)
            self.grid.place_agent(a, (x, y))

        self.datacollector = mesa.DataCollector(
            agent_reporters={"Letters_sent": "letters_sent", "Letters_received": "letters_received"},
            model_reporters={"All letters":compute_received_letters}
        )

    def step(self):
        self.schedule.step()
        self.datacollector.collect(self)
```

After every step of the model, the datacollector will collect and store each agent's letters_sent and letters_received value.

We run the model just as we did above. The `DataCollector` can export the data its collected as a pandas `DataFrame`, for easy interactive analysis.


```python
model = LetterModel(50, 10, 10)
for i in range(100):
    model.step()
```

We can now get the agent-letters data like this:


```python
agent_letters = model.datacollector.get_agent_vars_dataframe()
agent_letters.tail()
```

You'll see that the DataFrame's index is pairings of model step and agent ID. You can analyze it the way you would any other DataFrame. For example, to get a histogram of agent's letters sent at the model's end:


```python
end_letters = agent_letters.xs(99, level="Step")["Letters_sent"]
end_letters.hist(bins=range(agent_letters.Letters_sent.max() + 1))
```

Or to plot the letters received of a given agent (in this example, agent 14):


```python
one_agent_letters = agent_letters.xs(14, level="AgentID")
one_agent_letters.Letters_received.plot()
```

You can also use `pandas` to export the data to a CSV (comma separated value), which can be opened by any common spreadsheet application or opened by `pandas`.

If you do not specify a file path, the file will be saved in the local directory. After you run the code below you will see a file appear (*agent_data.csv*)


```python
# save the agent data (stored in the pandas agent_letters object) to CSV
agent_letters.to_csv("agent_data.csv")
```

#### 2.4.8 Visualization and Interactive Features of Mesa

More recently, the Mesa contributors have introduced a possibility to control and visualize a simulation directly in a notebook.

For this we need we need to define three components: the portrayal of the agents in the visualization, what parameters of the model we want to control, and finally the visualization itself.

For the portrayal we define the agents color and size. To have some visual cue on the model run, we change agents color once they have received a certain number of letters.


```python
def agent_portrayal(agent):
    color = "tab:blue"
    size = 5
    agents_letters = agent.letters_received
    if agents_letters > 5:
        size = agents_letters
    if agents_letters > 30:
        color = "tab:red"
    return {
        "color": color, "size": size,
    }
```

In the visualization we want to be able to control the number of agents to use. This is an interger number, which we allow to be changed from 10 to 100 agents in steps of one. The width and height of the grid will stay fixed in the simulation.

We additionaly introduce an option to switch between two modes of how the agents select neighbours for their letter sending. Both are randomly choosing from a list. If we select reinforce as True, the choice is weighted by the number of received letters of the neighbors. If agents received already some letters, the likeliness of receiveing more letters grows. In this way, we can allow agents to become more "famous".


```python
model_params = {
    "N": {
        "type": "SliderInt",
        "value": 50,
        "label": "Number of agents:",
        "min": 10,
        "max": 100,
        "step": 1,
    },
    "width": 10,
    "height": 10,
}
```

The model can be run within a visualization using the currently experimental visualization based on the Solara package.

The simulation is called with the model to run, its parameters, the measures that should be visible and the chosen agent style.

Try to run the model for a while. Do the agent colors change?


```python
from mesa.experimental import JupyterViz

simulation = JupyterViz(
    LetterModel,
    model_params,
    measures=["All letters"],
    name="LetterModel",
    agent_portrayal=agent_portrayal,
)

simulation
```

## Part 3: Open questions and next steps

Now we have a very simple model where agents send each other letters when they are close enough to each other, but otherwise walking aimlessly through their grid-like world. Of course, this model does not yet capture actual letter sending in a meaningful way.

In the real world, for example in the time of the Republic of Letters, people wouldn't have wandered at random, but maybe stayed at certain places and only on special, purposeful occasions change place. They would also know and remember the people they write to or receive letters from. Based on their familiarity and, crucially, the topical content of the communication, people would choose to write certain people more than others, not just their immediate neighbors. Out of this, an actually interesting social-epistemic network might arise and be analysed.

All of these features would be possible to implement with python and the simple methods we mentioned here and most of these we actually tried to model in the projects actual LetterModel on which we will have a look at next!

If you want more information and a more thorough introduction to mesa, you can either head to [the documentation of mesa](https://mesa.readthedocs.io/en/stable/overview.html), which features a variant of this tutorial and more on advanced features, especially built-in javascript-based visualization methods, or you can head to youtube [for a video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLF0b3ThojznRpQOd7iFukqXybbMV_vwZn) in a similar vein like the official mesa tutorials.

### 3.1 Extending the Model and building your own

### 3.2 Desiderata of Historical Agent-based Modeling Methodology

#### [OLD; OT BE MERGED HERE]: Fundamentals of Agent-based Modeling for Historians

In this section we want to go into more detail what *historical* Agent-based Models are about and what kinds of historical research questions they are able to deal with (as well as which they are not).

We also want to give some methodological and epistemological considerations which are important to think about before commiting to using the method.



#### [OLD; OT BE MERGED HERE] What are Historical Agent-based Models?

As we explained in the previous section, Agent-based Modeling is "particularly well suited to exploring how the aggregate characteristics of some system arise from the behaviour of its parts (Lake 2015). Agent-based Modeling is used to understand how the interaction of parts over time dynamically form a whole, i.e., the characteristics of a system, and how that system influences its parts in turn. Agent-based Modeling is less about establishing clear-cut, one-way causalities (although those may also play an important part) but more about uncovering complex webs of mutual influences, sometimes called 'feedbacks' or 'feedback loops'.

From this assessment, it may already become clear that classical historical methodology has some things in common with the goals of Agent-based Modeling, but how exactly does historical research look like that might benefit from this approach?

We want to give you some examples of historically motivated questions which might benefit from the application of Agent-based Modeling application:

*Examples for Research Questions*


  - How could changing climate conditions during the small ice age have influenced the interactions of brandenburgian peasants with their environment? Where they able to continue previous practices of extraction? Did they change them, and if yes, how, under which individual, economic, social, and environmental conditions? What change in these interactions could have led to the abandonment or continued survival of villages?
  - How did the changes in the built environment after Haussmann's 'renovation of Paris' influence the mobility of Parisians of different quarters? How do the effects on individual mobility compare to similar urban restructuring in London, Berlin, or other cities? How might different groups of people have adapted? Where subsequent urban building decisions more a reaction to the resulting mobility deficits / demands of citizens, or rather driven by policy visions (e.g., car-friendly cities in later decades)
  - What structural changes and individual decisions by farmers have led to the widespread adoption of high-intensive farming (i.e., machinization, motorization, and chemization of farming)? Was one of those more impactful than the other, e.g., were farmers 'forced' into it or did they push the structural changes by pioneering the technology? If the latter, what could be the reasons?

As you can see, all of these questions revolve around interactions of systemic changes (like climate, policy, or economy) and individual decisions (choosing how to extract resources from nature, choosing a mobility mode, choosing a farming practice). These kinds of questions are not necessarily typical of todays historical sciences, especially for those which concentrate on the micro-perspective of particular individuals. It won't be possible to make an Agent-based Model of, for example, the decisions of the individual Henry V. or, say, the life of one particular nun at a particular monastery - at least none that has a lot of use for answering a research question.

While they do emphasise heterogeneity in a group of individual actors, Agent-based Models do deal in aggregates and abstractions of people. This is because a model of anything must be a simplification of the real thing (or person). The crucial part is to choose all those elements of a thing or a person that are the most relevant in the processes the researcher is interested in. The end result of a historical Agent-based Modeling will always be one of many possible, narrowed down perspectives on history, not a perfectly complex, 1-to-1 reconstruction of historical reality. In that, Agent-based Modeling mirrors the hermeneutical process of interpretation in traditional historical science, a point we will elaborate on in the next section.

For that reason, it would be a misconception to characterize this approach as merely reductionist, as some historians have cautioned in the past - because at the same time, as hinted at above, fundamental for Agent-based Modeling (and its epistemological parent, systems science) is also the acknowledgement that any complex system will inherently be irreducible to just attributes of their parts, i.e., be explained just by that. This core concept of 'emergence' is a radically anti-reductionst view on reality a majority of historians probably share at least implicitly.

#### [OLD; OT BE MERGED HERE] Why do Agent-based Modeling in history?
The general description of Agent-based Modeling might have given you an idea already why this method might be of interest for historians. We already hinted in the end of the last section that the similarities on a methodological and even epistemological level to historical research can be rather striking. But we want to elaborate on some of those points and give you some more concrete arguments for how and why Agent-based Models can be useful for us historians.

**1) Modeling (Complex) Dynamics and Processes of History**
    
Agent-based Modeling pushes into a gap that other currently discussed digital humanities methods leave open, which are often concerned with static data and not the dynamics that connect different data points. A lot of historical inquiry however is revolving around dynamical, complex situations that change over time, as well as around corresponding questions of why and how these situations occurred in a specific way. Current DH methods and purely hermeneutic historical research, too, are not well equipped to model or analyze such time-sensitive dynamics of complex historical systems in a stringent and reproducible way.

**2) Modeling heterogenous historical agents**
    
Agent-based Modeling allows a huge amount of variability and freedom in modeling the behavior and interactions of agents. This makes Agent-based Modeling appealing for historians, who traditionally put a lot of emphasis on complex and creative behavior of human agents. That focus sets Agent-based Modeling apart from solely mathematical simulation methods which are usually less or even *un*able to model heterogeneous individual behavior, as explained briefly above.
    
**3) Theory-agnostic modeling of historical behaviors**
    
Agent-based Modeling makes it possible to model assumptions and theories about past behavior of diverse sets of agents with a diverse set of possible interactions. Contrary to a common conception, these assumptions and theories are not limited to a rational-choice paradigm at all (although there exists a large body of research using it for Agent-based Modeling). Of course, the formal modeling of behavior sets technical boundaries to the types of theories that can be represented, so the actual degree of freedom to use a specfic theory needs to be determined in practice.

**4) Extensive body of research in adjacent fields**
    
Not only might this method give a unique perspective to history, it is also tried and tested in many research fields adjacent to history, such as Archaeology, Sociology, Philosophy, or Economics. Especially the first field, Archaeology, has a lot to offer in terms of methodological and epistemological discussions, lessons learned, and specific application questions. A good place to get familiar with some discussions of Agent-based Modeling in Archaeology that are of interest for historians might be {cite}`wurzer_agent-based_2015`.

**5) Similarity to Hermeneutic Methodology**

*In this subsection, we will spend some time to discuss differences and similarities both in methodological and epistemological regards in relation to the more commonplace hermeneutic approaches to history.*

- DIFF: strict formalization of concepts / people / behavior!
- SIM: iterative, interpretative modeling -> "hermeneutic figure-8" (Gavin 2015)
- SIM/DIFF: counter-factuals (ie., mental hypothesizing), but explicated and testable
- DIFF: experiments!
- ...
