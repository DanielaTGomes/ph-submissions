For Contributors

## File Formatting

We publish all our lessons in Markdown. Lessons should be titled: "lesson-name". The lesson markdown file will be uploaded to the corresponding language folder (for example, "en"), and placed either in the drafts/originals directory or the drafts/translations directory. Sample lessons, with proper yaml header, can be viewed in these directories.

Image files should be named: "lesson-image-1", "lesson-image-2". Image files go in the images directory, inside a folder named with the same slug as your lesson.
